With the arrival of technology and start-ups in the current industry, the demand for innovation and resilience 
has been increased. Because of the current competition among rival companies working in the same field, 
the emphasis on high productivity has grown significantly. Due to the high focus on profits and 
productivity, the founders of these companies are usually under a lot of stress, and as a result, employees 
of these companies face the same stress due to tight deadlines, unusual hours, and late nights. This has 
resulted in a decline in mental health as well as an increase in absenteeism and long-term stress, which is 
exactly the opposite of what the current industry desires. Using exploratory data analysis, we focused on 
mental health, its predictors, and the effects it has on the productivity of the tech industry. The study has 
been done on use of data mining and apply some of the techniques including Support Vector Machines 
(SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) to predict whether the employee who is dealing 
with mental health issues has sought treatment for the same and if so then what factors influenced this 
decision.
